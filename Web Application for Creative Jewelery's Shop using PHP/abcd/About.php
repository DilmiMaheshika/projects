            <p align="center" >It is a fact that most customers prefer to buy high-end items from brick-and-mortar stores, which are perceived as more reliable and provide the opportunity to touch and feel the merchandise. This is a crucial factor in a high-involvement category such as jewellery driven by sensory experience. Our spacious showroom is designed with the idea of a unique shopping experience, showcasing the spellbinding beauty and breathe of the Creative product range.

                The studio is decked out in state of the art technology and all equipment and space required that allows for the artisans and craftsmen to give of their best, and create masterpieces of jewellery.

                From a small cluster of 5 loyal employees we have risen and expanded to a stellar staff of 400 persons a testament to our resilience in a highly competitive industry and our ambition and drive to be a strong national brand in Sri Lanka.</p>
